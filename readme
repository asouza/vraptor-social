1 - it is not mavenized, so you have to follow the build.sbt to get the dependencies
2 - copy the jar that is in dist folder to your web-inf/lib

Using

  1 - To generate the oauth urls to login users just receive Twitter|FacebookAuthorizationUrlProvider as parameter in 
      your constructor. After that, just invoke the getUrl method.
  2 - To get profile information about the logged user, just receive Twitter|FacebookOperations as parameter in your
      constructor. After that, you can invoke the getProfile method to access some informations.
  3 - Finally, you have to configure your access credentials to access the platform. Below you have the keys that
      must be created in development|productions.properties. This project uses vraptor-environment plugin to do not
      obligate you to create another properties file.
